    <h1><strong>Tre Sonna's Background</strong></h1>
                <p>
                    Tre Sonna was Born Niemel Ngatchou Sonna in Phoenix, Arizona. He was a 3 sport athlete all through Highschool playing Basketball, Soccer, and Football
                    He has lived in 2 countries and 5 states (oregon, Indiana, Washington, and Arizona,)
                    Tre hopes to grow up and work in either computer and web delopment or Real estate, Hopefully Both.
                    I grew up without much, which is what really fuels my hunger, desire, and drive to be somebody. Throughout the years i watched my mom struggle but endure as a single parent and an immigrant
                    having never had a solid relationship or any relationship with my father for the entire extent of my life. I look Up to her because shes a testament of whatan individual can achieve in this 
                    world if they go out and strive for it. My education background is rather subtle, boucned around alot as a kid so i went to many different elementary,middle, and high schools, but i will be 
                    graduating from woodinville high school among the class of 2020. While in HIgh School i was a 3 sport varsity athlete playing Basketball , Football, and Track and Field at the Varsity Level.
                    Currently though i wanted my life to take a route of Business and academia rather than sports and entertainment and while i do still frequently attend the gym on my spare time and go on runs
                    as a hobby i also take alot of time to read and im actually very devoted in my religious faith as well.
