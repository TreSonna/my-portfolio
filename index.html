            <strong>Tre Sonna's Background</strong>
                            <p>
                                Tre Sonna was Born Niemel Ngatchou Sonna in Phoenix, Arizona. He was a 3 sport athlete all through Highschool playing Basketball, Soccer, and Football
                                He has lived in 2 countries and 5 states (oregon, Indiana, Washington, and Arizona,)
                                Tre hopes to grow up and work in either computer and web delopment or Real estate, Hopefully Both.
                                I grew up without much, which is what really fuels my hunger, desire, and drive to be somebody. Throughout the years i watched my mom struggle but endure as a single parent and an immigrant
                                having never had a solid relationship or any relationship with my father for the entire extent of my life. I look Up to her because shes a testament of whatan individual can achieve in this 
                                world if they go out and strive for it. My education background is rather subtle, boucned around alot as a kid so i went to many different elementary,middle, and high schools, but i will be 
                                graduating from woodinville high school among the class of 2020. While in HIgh School i was a 3 sport varsity athlete playing Basketball , Football, and Track and Field at the Varsity Level.
                                Currently though i wanted my life to take a route of Business and academia rather than sports and entertainment and while i do still frequently attend the gym on my spare time and go on runs
                                as a hobby i also take alot of time to read and im actually very devoted in my religious faith as well.

                                I am Hoping to go through epicodus and gain the hands on expirience as well as not only learning how the world of coding works, but learning how to be able to really learn and absorb information to be able to innnovate. 
                                Im not in epicodus in terms of looking for work ( I am in the Long Run) but for right now this class is more to further my education giving me a vast amount of base knowledge before pursuing a degree at an accredited next
                                level education institution. I would describe my personality as very outgoing, and in terms of education i tend to always be slow at picking up a concept but once i do i tend to really take off with it.
                                as a learner please be patient with my progression at the start as i am trying genuinely to do the best i can. In addition to coding Tre dabbles in Real Estate as well as Selling insurnce, hes driven and looking to be
                                successful as he continues to grow in life and in his career aspirations. as for athletcis and individual hobbies, I love sports. My 5 favorite sports in order are as listed
